# Story 1.1: Setup base Next.js project

**Status:** Draft

## Story
As a Developer, I want to set up the base Next.js project with PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, and Tailwind CSS, so that we have a functional foundation for development.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Next.js project initialized and running
- PostgreSQL database configured and accessible
- Drizzle ORM integrated and connected to database
- Tailwind CSS configured and styles applied
- Project builds and runs without errors

## Dev Technical Guidance
- Use `npx create-next-app` to initialize project ([Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#nextjs])
- Configure PostgreSQL connection in `.env` ([Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#postgresql])
- Integrate Drizzle ORM as per [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#orm]
- Setup Tailwind CSS following [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#tailwind]
- Ensure code follows project structure in [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Apply coding standards from [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- No specific guidance found in architecture docs for CI/CD integration

## Tasks / Subtasks
1. [x] Initialize Next.js project (`npx create-next-app`)
2. [x] Configure PostgreSQL database and add connection details to `.env`
3. [x] Install and configure Drizzle ORM
4. [x] Install and configure Tailwind CSS
5. [x] Verify project builds and runs
6. [x] Ensure file/folder structure matches unified project structure
7. [x] Review code for adherence to coding standards
8. [x] Add README setup instructions

## Testing Guidance
- [ ] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Integration Test: location: `/tests/story-1.1/`
- [ ] E2E: location: `/e2e/story-1.1/`

Manual Test Steps:
- Run `npm run build` and `npm run dev` to verify project starts
- Confirm Tailwind styles render on homepage
- Check database connection by running a test query
