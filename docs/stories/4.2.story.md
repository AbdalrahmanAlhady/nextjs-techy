# Story 4.2: As a Buyer, I can view a detailed product page

## Status: Completed

## Story

- As a Buyer
- I want to view a detailed product page
- so that I can get all the necessary information before making a purchase decision.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- [x] Clicking a product on the main listing page navigates to a unique URL for that product (e.g., `/products/[productId]`).
- [x] The page displays the product's name, a gallery of images, a detailed description, price, and available stock.
- [x] An "Add to Cart" button is present and functional.
- [x] The page displays product ratings and reviews left by other buyers (covered in Story 4.6).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2): Create the dynamic route and UI for the detailed product page.
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Implement a server action to fetch a single product's details by its ID.
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Build the image gallery component.
- [x] Task 2 (AC: 3): Implement the "Add to Cart" functionality.
- [x] Task 3 (AC: 4): Create a component to display product ratings and reviews.

## Dev Notes

- This page should be dynamically rendered using Server-Side Rendering (SSR) to ensure the latest product data (like stock) is shown.
- The `[productId]` will be used to fetch the specific product data.
- The "Add to Cart" action should update the cart state, which will likely be managed by Redux Toolkit (see Story 4.3).

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [x] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [x] Cypress E2E: location: `/e2e/epic-4/product-detail.test.ts`

Manual Test Steps:

- From the product listing page, click on any product.
- Verify you are taken to the correct URL and the page displays all the correct product details.
- Click the "Add to Cart" button and verify the cart is updated.
