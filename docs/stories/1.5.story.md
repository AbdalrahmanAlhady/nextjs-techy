# Story 1.5: Role-Based Access Enforcement

**Summary:**  
Access to protected routes and features is now enforced based on user role. Unauthorized users are redirected or shown an error.

**Status:** Complete

## Story
As a user, I want the application to restrict access to certain routes and features based on my role, so that only authorized users can access sensitive or privileged functionality.

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- Admin-only pages and APIs are inaccessible to non-admins.
- Vendors and buyers can only access their respective dashboards and features.
- Unauthorized access attempts result in a redirect to the sign-in page or an "Unauthorized" error message.
- UI elements for restricted actions are hidden or disabled for unauthorized roles.

## File List
- `/app/middleware.ts` (route protection)
- `/app/admin` (admin dashboard)
- `/app/vendor` (vendor dashboard)
- `/app/buyer` (buyer dashboard)
- `/app/actions/get-session.ts` (session/role checking)
