# Story 3.3: Vendor Order Management

**Status:** Complete ✅

## Story
As a Vendor, I want to view and update the status of orders that contain my products so that I can fulfill them and keep buyers informed.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Vendors dashboard has an "Orders" section.
2. List shows orders where at least one order item belongs to the vendor.
3. Vendor can view order details (items, buyer info, shipping address, current status).
4. Vendor can update item-level status: `PENDING` → `PROCESSING` → `SHIPPED` → `DELIVERED`.
5. Updates trigger email notification to buyer.
6. Permissions enforced: vendor cannot see items from other vendors.
7. List & detail pages support pagination.
8. Unit & integration tests ≥ 80 % coverage.

## Dev Technical Guidance
- Use Drizzle joins to fetch order items filtered by vendorId.
- Create actions in `app/actions/vendor-orders.ts`.
- Email util already exists.
- Reuse existing status badge components.

## Tasks / Subtasks
1. [x] Build `/vendor/orders` list page.
2. [x] Build `/vendor/orders/[id]` detail page.
3. [x] Implement status update action with email notifications.
4. [x] Add input validation and error handling.
5. [x] Implement status transition validation.
6. [x] Add transaction handling for database operations.
