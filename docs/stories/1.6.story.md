# Story 1.6: Implement Sign-Out Flow

**Summary:**  
Users can securely sign out, clearing their authentication cookie and returning them to the sign-in screen.

**Status:** Complete

## Story
As an authenticated user, I want a clear way to sign out so that I can securely end my session and protect my account on shared devices.

---

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A “Sign Out” control is present in the Header when the user is signed in.
2. Clicking the control triggers a server action that:
   - Deletes the `auth_token` cookie.
   - Performs a server-side redirect to `/sign-in`.
3. Page refresh confirms cookie is gone; user is considered signed-out.
4. Control is not rendered when the user is already signed-out.
5. Implementation follows App Router best-practices (no client-side infinite redirect loops).

---

## Technical Notes (Done)
- Added `app/actions/auth/sign-out.ts` server action.
- Replaced `/sign-out` route handler.
- Header now wraps Sign-Out in a form using that server action.
