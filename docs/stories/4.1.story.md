# Story 4.1: As a Buyer, I can view all products

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a Buyer
- I want to view all available products
- so that I can browse and decide what to purchase.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- [ ] A main "Shop" or "Products" page is available and accessible to all users.
- [ ] The page displays products in a grid or list format.
- [ ] Each product listing shows at least the product image, name, and price.
- [ ] Clicking on a product listing navigates to the detailed product page (covered in Story 4.2).
- [ ] Pagination is implemented if the number of products exceeds a reasonable limit per page (e.g., 20).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3): Create the main product listing page UI.
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Fetch all approved products from the database.
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Implement the grid/list view component for products.
- [x] Task 2 (AC: 4): Implement navigation to the detailed product page.
- [x] Task 3 (AC: 5): Add pagination controls and logic.

## Dev Notes

- The page should be server-rendered (SSR) or statically generated (SSG) for optimal performance.
- Fetch products using a server action or API route that queries the `products` table for items with an 'approved' status.
- Ensure product images are optimized for the web.
