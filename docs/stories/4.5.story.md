# Story 4.5: As a Buyer, I can view my order history

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a Buyer
- I want to view my order history
- so that I can track my past purchases and their status.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- [ ] A link to the "Order History" page is available in the user's profile or account section.
- [ ] The page lists all past orders placed by the user.
- [ ] Each order in the list displays the order ID, date placed, total amount, and current status (e.g., Processing, Shipped, Delivered).
- [ ] Clicking on an order reveals more details, including the items purchased and the shipping address used.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3): Create the main order history page UI.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Implement a server action to fetch all orders for the currently logged-in user.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Build the list view to display summary information for each order.
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 4): Implement the detailed order view.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: This could be an expandable section within the list or a separate page.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Fetch and display the specific items and shipping details for the selected order.

## Dev Notes

- This page must be protected and only accessible to logged-in users.
- The server action should query the `orders` table based on the `userId` from the session.

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
