# US208: As a Developer, I need to seed the database with test data

## Description
To facilitate development and testing of the application, the database needs to be populated with a set of realistic fake data. This will allow for testing of features like user management, product display, and vendor approval workflows without needing to manually create data.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A seed script is created at `packages/db/seed.ts`.
- The script uses `@faker-js/faker` to generate realistic data.
- A new script `db:seed` is added to `package.json` to execute the seed script.
- When executed, the script will generate the following data:
  - **Users:**
    - 3 users with the `VENDOR` role, with `vendorStatus` set to `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, and `REJECTED` respectively.
    - 2 users with the `BUYER` role, with `status` set to `ACTIVE` and `SUSPENDED` respectively.
  - **Categories:**
    - 2 distinct product categories.
  - **Products:**
    - 4 products in total.
    - 2 products assigned to the first category.
    - 2 products assigned to the second category.
    - All products must be assigned to the vendor with the `APPROVED` status.
