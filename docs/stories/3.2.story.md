# Story 3.2: Vendor Product Management

**Status:** Complete

## Story
As an approved Vendor, I want to add, edit, archive, and delete my own products so that I can keep my catalog up to date.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Vendors dashboard has a "Products" section listing only their products.
2. Vendor can add a new product with the same schema as Admin but without changing `vendorId`.
3. Vendor can edit existing product fields (name, description, price, stock, status, image).
4. Vendor can archive (soft-delete) products; archived products are hidden from buyers.
5. Validation rules identical to admin product form.
6. Permissions enforced: vendor cannot read or mutate products owned by another vendor.
7. CRUD actions have success/error toasts.
8. Unit & integration tests > 80 % coverage.

## Dev Technical Guidance
- Reuse `ProductForm` by prop-injecting `vendorId`.
- Protect routes with vendor role middleware.
- Endpoints in `app/actions/vendor-products.ts` leveraging existing admin actions with vendor guard.
- Update Drizzle queries to filter by `vendorId`.

## Tasks / Subtasks
1. [x] Build `/vendor/products` list page.
2. [x] Create `/vendor/products/add` and `/vendor/products/edit/[id]` pages.
3. [x] Implement vendor-scoped actions.
4. [x] Add soft delete/archive toggle.

## File List
- `/app/(dashboard)/vendor/products/*`
- `/app/actions/vendor-products.ts`
