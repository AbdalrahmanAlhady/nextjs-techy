# Story 1.3: Build Authentication UI

**Summary:**
The sign-in and sign-up pages have been implemented using server actions for all authentication logic. Form validation, error handling, and secure session management are in place. The UI leverages the design system, and all requirements for authentication UI are complete.

**Status:** Complete

## Story
As a Developer, I want to build the sign-up and sign-in pages, so that users can create an account and log in.

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- A sign-in page exists at `/app/(auth)/sign-in` with:
  - Email and password fields
  - Form validation and error messages
  - Calls the server action for sign-in
  - Handles success (redirects, sets session) and failure (shows error)
- A sign-up page exists at `/app/(auth)/sign-up` with:
  - Name, email, and password fields
  - Form validation and error messages
  - Calls the server action for sign-up
  - Handles success (redirects, notifies user) and failure (shows error)
- UI uses components from your design system (e.g., lovable-techy-ui)
- No client-side NextAuth code (SessionProvider, useSession, etc.)
- All authentication logic is handled via server actions and secure cookies
- Responsive and accessible UI

## Tasks / Subtasks
1. [x] Create `/app/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx` (Sign-in UI)
2. [x] Create `/app/(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx` (Sign-up UI)
3. [x] Implement form validation (e.g., zod, react-hook-form)
4. [x] Wire forms to server actions (`signInAction`, `signUpAction`)
5. [x] Display error/success messages to the user
6. [x] Use UI components from design system
7. [x] Add tests for form validation and server action integration

---

## Testing Guidance
- [x] Manual: Sign in and sign up with demo credentials
- [x] Check error handling for invalid credentials or duplicate emails
- [x] Verify session cookie is set on successful sign-in
- [x] Confirm UI is responsive and accessible

---

## File List
- `/app/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx`
- `/app/(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx`
- `/app/actions/auth.ts`
- `/app/actions/get-session.ts`
- `lovable-techy-ui` (UI components)
