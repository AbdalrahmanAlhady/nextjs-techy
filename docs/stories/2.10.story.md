# 2.10: Easy Navigation to Main Dashboard

**User Story:** As an Admin, I want to easily navigate back to the main dashboard from any primary admin page, so that I can quickly move between different management sections.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] A "Return to Home" button is present on the main `/admin/users` page.
- [x] A "Return to Home" button is present on the main `/admin/vendors` page.
- [x] A "Return to Home" button is present on the main `/admin/categories` page.
- [x] A "Return to Home" button is present on the main `/admin/products` page.
