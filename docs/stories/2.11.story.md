# 2.11: Consistent Role Indicators

**User Story:** As an Admin, I want to see consistent role indicators across the dashboard, so that I can quickly and easily identify user roles at a glance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] User roles (Admin, Vendor, Customer) are displayed as colored chips in the user management table.
- [x] User roles are displayed as colored chips on the user profile page.
- [x] Vendor roles are displayed as colored chips on the vendor profile page.
- [x] The color of the chip corresponds to the role type for easy visual identification.

## Technical Notes

- Create a reusable `RoleChip` component to ensure consistency.
- The `RoleChip` component should contain the logic for mapping roles to specific colors and styles.
- Update the `UserTable`, `UserProfilePage`, and `VendorProfilePage` to use the new `RoleChip` component.
