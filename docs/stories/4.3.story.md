# Story 4.3: As a Buyer, I can manage my shopping cart

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a Buyer
- I want to manage my shopping cart
- so that I can review my selected items, adjust quantities, and proceed to checkout.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- [ ] An icon or link to the shopping cart is always visible in the site header, showing the number of items in it.
- [ ] The shopping cart page lists all items added, showing their name, image, price, and quantity.
- [ ] I can update the quantity of any item in the cart.
- [ ] I can remove an item from the cart.
- [ ] The cart displays a subtotal, shipping costs (if applicable), and a total price.
- [ ] A "Proceed to Checkout" button is clearly visible.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2): Implement the shopping cart state management using Redux Toolkit.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Define the cart slice with actions for adding, removing, and updating items.
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 2, 3, 4): Create the UI for the shopping cart page.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Build components to display cart items.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Implement quantity update and item removal functionality.
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 5): Implement the logic to calculate totals.
- [ ] Task 4 (AC: 6): Add the "Proceed to Checkout" button linking to the checkout page (Story 4.4).

## Dev Notes

- The shopping cart state should persist even if the user refreshes the page. Use `redux-persist` or a similar library to save the cart state to local storage.
- All cart modifications should immediately reflect in the UI and the totals.

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Cypress E2E: location: `/e2e/epic-4/shopping-cart.test.ts`

Manual Test Steps:

- Add several different products to the cart.
- Navigate to the cart page and verify all items are listed correctly.
- Change the quantity of an item and verify the subtotal and total update.
- Remove an item and verify it disappears from the cart and totals are recalculated.
