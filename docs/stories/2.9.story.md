# 2.9: View Detailed User and Vendor Profiles

**User Story:** As an Admin, I want to view detailed user and vendor profiles, so that I can access all relevant information about a specific individual in one place.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] When an admin clicks the "view" icon on a user row in the user management table, they are navigated to a dedicated profile page for that user.
- [x] The user profile page displays the user's name, email, role, status, and join date.
- [x] When an admin clicks the "view" icon on a vendor row in the vendor management table, they are navigated to a dedicated profile page for that vendor.
- [x] The vendor profile page displays the vendor's name, email, role, status, vendor status, and join date.
- [x] Both profile pages have a "Back" button to return to the previous table view.

## Technical Notes

- Create dynamic routes: `/admin/users/[id]` and `/admin/vendors/[id]`.
- Implement `getUserById` and `getVendorById` server actions to fetch data.
- Utilize the reusable `BackButton` component for navigation.
