# Story 1.7: Build User Profile Page

**Summary:**  
Authenticated users can view a profile page showing their personal details and account status.

**Status:** Complete

## Story
As a logged-in user, I want a dedicated profile page so that I can review my account information in one place.

---

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Route `/profile` is accessible only when authenticated; unauthenticated visitors are redirected to `/sign-in`.
2. Page displays:
   - Name, email, account creation date.
   - Current role badge (Admin, Vendor, Buyer).
   - Vendor status badge when applicable.
3. Layout matches site design standards; mobile-responsive.
4. Header includes link to profile when signed-in.
5. Unit test covers redirect logic and rendering.

## Technical Notes (Done)
- Created `app/profile/page.tsx` server component with session guard.
- Styled badges and page using Tailwind.
- Added role-aware navigation link in `Header`.
