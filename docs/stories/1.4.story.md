# Story 1.4: Define and Assign User Roles

**Summary:**
User roles (ADMIN, VENDOR, BUYER) are now fully supported in the database schema, assigned at sign-up, and included in the session/JWT. All requirements for role management and access control foundation are complete.

**Status:** Complete

## Story
As a Developer, I want to define and assign user roles in the database, so that the application can differentiate between Admins, Vendors, and Buyers.

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] The `users` table in the database includes a `role` column with at least: `ADMIN`, `VENDOR`, `BUYER`.
- [x] Roles are assigned at user creation (default: `BUYER`) and can be updated by an admin.
- [x] Server actions and UI logic use the role for access control.
- [x] Role is included in the session/JWT payload.
- [x] Tests confirm correct role assignment and retrieval.

---

## Tasks / Subtasks
1. [x] Update database schema to include and document user roles.
2. [x] Update sign-up logic to assign default role (`BUYER`).
3. [x] Implement admin functionality to update user roles (optional for MVP).
4. [x] Ensure role is included in JWT/session and accessible via server actions.
5. [x] Add tests for role assignment, update, and session payload.

---

## Testing Guidance
- Create users via sign-up and confirm role in DB/session.
- Update a user's role (if admin functionality implemented) and verify.
- Attempt to access protected routes as different roles.

## File List
- `/packages/db/schema.ts` (users table)
- `/app/actions/auth.ts` (role assignment in sign-up)
- `/app/actions/get-session.ts` (role in session)
- `/app/admin` (admin role management UI, optional)
