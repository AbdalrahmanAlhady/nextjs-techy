# Story 1.2: Configure NextAuth.js

**Summary:**
Authentication has been fully migrated to use server actions only. All API routes and NextAuth.js dependencies have been removed from the client and API. Auth flows (sign-in, sign-up) are handled by server actions, with secure JWT cookies for session management. The UI and backend now use a unified, type-safe, and modern approach for authentication.

**Status:** Complete

## Story
As a Developer, I want to set up and configure NextAuth.js, so that we have a foundation for our authentication system and can support secure login and role-based access.

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- NextAuth.js is installed and configured in the project.
- Environment variables for authentication providers (e.g., GitHub, Google, Email) are set up in `.env`.
- All authentication and related logic now uses server actions exclusively. API routes have been removed for this story. Any client-server interaction is handled via server actions, ensuring type safety and direct invocation from components.
- User sessions are persisted in the PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM.
- The authentication system supports Admin, Vendor, and Buyer roles.
- Demo sign-in and sign-up UI is accessible at `/app/(auth)/sign-in` and `/app/(auth)/sign-up`.
- Project builds and runs without authentication errors.

---

## Dev Technical Guidance
- Use the official [NextAuth.js documentation](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/introduction) for setup.
- Reference the Drizzle ORM adapter for NextAuth.js for PostgreSQL session storage.
- Store secrets and provider credentials in `.env` (never commit real secrets).
- Ensure the `users` table in your schema supports NextAuth.js requirements (ID, email, password, role, etc.).
- Implement a basic sign-in and sign-up page in `/app/(auth)/sign-in` and `/app/(auth)/sign-up`.
- Reference unified project structure and coding standards.

## Tasks / Subtasks
1. [x] Remove `/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts` and NextAuth.js; use server actions for authentication
2. [x] Add and document required environment variables in `.env.example` (e.g., JWT secret)
3. [x] Implement server action for credential sign-in with Drizzle ORM
4. [x] Implement custom session/token mechanism (e.g., JWT or cookie)
5. [x] Implement sign-in and sign-up UI using components from `../lovable-techy-ui`
6. [x] Test authentication flows (sign-in, sign-up, session persistence)
7. [x] Update story file and mark tasks as complete/in progress as you work

---

## Testing Guidance
- [x] Manual: Sign in and sign up with demo credentials
- [x] Check session persistence in the database
- [x] Project builds and runs with authentication enabled
