# Story 3.4: Order Status Management for Multi-Vendor Orders

**Status:** In Progress ðŸš§

## Story
As a Vendor and Store Administrator, I want a clear and automated order status management system that handles both individual item status and overall order status so that customers receive accurate updates and vendors can manage orders effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Each order item maintains its own status independently
2. The order's overall status is automatically calculated based on its items
3. Email notifications are sent for all status changes
4. Status transitions are validated and enforced
5. System handles partial and full order cancellations
6. Permissions are enforced for status updates
7. Comprehensive test coverage for all status flows

## Dev Technical Guidance
- Extend existing `updateOrderItemStatus` function
- Add `updateOrderStatus` function for automatic order status calculation
- Update email templates for different status scenarios
- Add database migration for new `PARTIALLY_CANCELED` status
- Use transactions for status updates to maintain data consistency
- Implement proper error handling and logging

## Tasks / Subtasks
1. [ ] Add `PARTIALLY_CANCELED` to order status enum in schema
2. [ ] Implement `updateOrderStatus` function
3. [ ] Update email templates for different status scenarios
4. [ ] Add status transition validation
5. [ ] Implement order status calculation logic
6. [ ] Add unit and integration tests
7. [ ] Update documentation

## Implementation Details

### Key Features
- **Order Status Calculation**: Automatic calculation of order status based on items
- **Status Transitions**: Enforced valid status transitions for both orders and items
- **Email Notifications**: Contextual emails for different status change scenarios
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Data Consistency**: Transaction-based updates to maintain data integrity

### Status Flow
- **Order Statuses**:
  - `PENDING` â†’ `PROCESSING` â†’ `SHIPPED` â†’ `DELIVERED`
  - Can transition to `PARTIALLY_CANCELED` or `CANCELED`
- **Item Statuses**:
  - `PENDING` â†’ `PROCESSING` â†’ `SHIPPED` â†’ `DELIVERED`
  - Can transition to `CANCELED` at any point

### Email Templates
1. **Item Status Update**:
   - Subject: "Order #123 Update: [Product] status updated to [STATUS]"
   - Content: Shows item details and new status

2. **Item Canceled (Partial Order)**:
   - Subject: "Item Canceled in Order #123"
   - Content: Specifies which item was canceled, order continues with other items

3. **Full Order Canceled**:
   - Subject: "Order #123 Has Been Canceled"
   - Content: Informs that all items were canceled and order is closed
