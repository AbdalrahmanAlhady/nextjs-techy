# Story 4.6: As a Buyer, I can leave a rating and review

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a Buyer
- I want to leave a rating and review for a product I purchased
- so that I can share my feedback with the vendor and other potential buyers.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- [x] On the order history page, there is a section for writing a review for each purchased product.
- [x] Only users who have purchased the product are able to leave a review (enforced by order history context).
- [x] The review form includes a star rating (1-5) and a text area for comments.
- [x] Submitting the form saves the rating and review to the database, associated with the product and the user.
- [x] The product's average rating is updated and displayed on the product detail and listing pages. The product detail page displays reviews and average rating, but does not allow review submission.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2, 3): Create the review submission form UI in the order history page for each purchased product.
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Implement logic to check if the current user has purchased the product (via order history context).
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Build the star rating input component.
- [x] Task 2 (AC: 4): Implement the server action to save the review.
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Add the review to a `reviews` table in the database.
- [x] Task 3 (AC: 5): Implement the logic to calculate and display the average rating.
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Calculate average rating when fetching product review data. Display reviews and average rating on product detail page.

## Dev Notes

- The check to see if a user has purchased a product is critical to ensure review authenticity. This will involve querying the `orders` and `order_items` tables.
- The `reviews` table should include `productId`, `userId`, `rating`, `comment`, and a timestamp.

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Cypress E2E: location: `/e2e/epic-4/product-review.test.ts`

Manual Test Steps:

- Purchase a product.
- Navigate to that product's detail page.
- Write and submit a review.
- Verify your review is now visible on the page.
- Check if the product's average rating has been updated on both the detail and listing pages.
