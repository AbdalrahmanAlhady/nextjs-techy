# 3.5: Easy Navigation from Nested Vendor Pages

**User Story:** As a Vendor, I want to easily navigate back from any nested page, so that I can return to the previous screen without using the browser's back button.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] A "Back" button is present on the order details page (`/vendor/orders/[id]`)
- [x] A "Back" button is present on the add product page (`/vendor/products/add`).
- [x] A "Back" button is present on the edit product page (`/vendor/products/edit/[id]`).
- [x] Clicking the button navigates the user to the previous page in the application's history.

## Technical Notes

- Utilize the reusable `BackButton` component.
- Ensure the `BackButton` is added to all nested vendor routes.
