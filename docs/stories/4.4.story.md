# Story 4.4: As a Buyer, I can complete the checkout process

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a Buyer
- I want to complete the checkout process securely and efficiently
- so that I can finalize my purchase.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- [ ] The checkout page requires the user to be logged in.
- [ ] The page displays a summary of the order (items, quantities, total price).
- [ ] The user must provide or confirm a shipping address.
- [ ] The user must provide payment information (e.g., via a Stripe Elements form).
- [ ] Upon successful payment, an order is created in the database.
- [ ] The user is redirected to an order confirmation page.
- [ ] The user's cart is cleared after a successful order.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1): Implement a route guard to ensure only authenticated users can access the checkout page.
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 2, 3): Build the checkout page UI, including the order summary and shipping address form.
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 4): Integrate a payment gateway like Stripe.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Create a serverless function or API route to handle payment intent creation.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Implement the Stripe Elements form on the frontend.
- [ ] Task 4 (AC: 5, 7): Create a server action to process the order after successful payment.
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Save the order details to the `orders` and `order_items` tables.
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Clear the user's cart from the Redux state.
- [ ] Task 5 (AC: 6): Create the order confirmation page.

## Dev Notes

- Ensure all sensitive operations, especially payment processing and order creation, are handled securely on the server-side.
- Use environment variables to store API keys for the payment gateway.
- The database schema will need to support `orders` and `order_items` tables.

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Jest with in memory db Integration Test (Test Location): `/tests/checkout/order-processing.spec.ts`
