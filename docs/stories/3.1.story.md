# Story 3.1: Implement Vendor Registration Flow

**Status:** Complete

## Story
As a prospective Vendor, I want to submit a registration application so that the marketplace admin can review and approve me to sell products on the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A publicly accessible "Become a Vendor" page exists.
2. The page contains a form that captures at minimum: business name, contact email, website (optional), description, and logo.
3. Form validates required fields client-side and server-side.
4. On submit, an application record is persisted with status `PENDING`.
5. Applicant receives confirmation email that their application is received.
6. Admin dashboard lists new applications under Vendors with status `PENDING`.
7. All interactions are protected against spam (hCaptcha or rate-limiting) and basic XSS.
8. Unit & integration tests cover happy path and validation errors (coverage â‰¥ 80 %).

## Dev Technical Guidance
- Follow existing `/admin/vendors` DB schema & Drizzle migrations (see `packages/db`).
- Use React Hook Form + Zod for validation (see CategoryForm pattern).
- Send confirmation email through existing `@/app/actions/send-email` util.
- Place public form at `/vendor/apply` (outside auth gate).
- Reference architecture docs: `architecture/unified-project-structure.md`, `architecture/coding-standards.md`.

## Tasks / Subtasks
1. [x] Design and build `/vendor-application` page and route (implemented as `/vendor-application`).
2. [x] Create server action `applyForVendorStatus` (persists status `PENDING`).
3. [x] Integrate email service for confirmation.
4. [x] Update admin Vendors table if necessary.

## Completion Notes List
- Vendor application flow fully implemented; confirmation emails sent; admin table updated.

## File List
- `/app/vendor-application/page.tsx`
