# üì¶ Project Brief: nextjs-techy

## üß≠ Executive Summary

**Techy** is a curated, multi-vendor e-commerce platform for tech enthusiasts and hardware makers. Unlike mass-market platforms, Techy focuses on trusted, high-quality products from independent tech vendors. The platform empowers small vendors with tools and visibility while providing buyers with authentic products and reliable reviews.

## ‚ùó Problem Statement

Large marketplaces like Amazon prioritize volume over quality. Small, innovative vendors struggle to gain visibility. Tech-savvy buyers face fake reviews, poor discovery, and untrustworthy listings. There‚Äôs a growing need for a focused, curated platform that connects passionate makers with quality-seeking buyers.

## ‚úÖ Proposed Solution

Techy solves this with three pillars:
- **Curation & Trust**: Manual vendor approval, verified buyer reviews, and product reputation scores.
- **Vendor Empowerment**: A vendor dashboard for managing products and viewing buyer orders.
- **Community & Discovery**: Smooth Browse, clean checkout, and high-trust ratings.

- Ages 25‚Äì50: developers, gamers, prosumers.
